# EN5423: Data Analysis and Statistical Inference

## Course Outline
This course is designed to simplify the complex world of data analysis. It starts by teaching the basics of statistical inference, making smart guesses and decisions based on data. It then shifts to big data analysis, exploring how to handle, analyze, and draw conclusions from large datasets using modern techniques and tools. This course is ideal for anyone looking to make informed decisions using data, blending foundational statistical concepts with practical big data applications in a clear, straightforward manner.

## Prerequisites
- Knowledge in linear regression analysis, statistical inference, and linear algebra.
- Basic working knowledge in a scientific programming language (e.g., Python, Matlab, R, etc).
- All course examples will be in Python.

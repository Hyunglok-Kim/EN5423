99% Confidence Interval Calculation for Arsenic Concentration
-------------------------------------------------------------
Given Data:
Sample mean (x) = 98.4 parts per billion (ppb)
Standard deviation (s) = 144.7 ppb
Z-score (Z) for a 99% confidence interval = 2.787
Sample size (n) = 25

Using the equation for a 99% confidence interval:
CI = x ± (Z × (s / √n))

Where CI is the confidence interval, x is the sample mean, s is the standard deviation, Z is the Z-score for a 99% confidence interval, and n is the sample size.

Calculated Confidence Interval:
Lower Bound = 17.74 ppb
Upper Bound = 179.06 ppb

This means that we are 99% confident that the true mean arsenic concentration in the population lies between 17.74 ppb and 179.06 ppb.
